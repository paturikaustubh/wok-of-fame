# Wok of Fame

## Overview
Wok of Fame is a Chinese restaurant that provides best quality Chinese dishes at affordable rates. This is a fully responsive website which allows viewers to order food directly from the restaurant or reserve a table.
This is just an idea of how the website would look and mainly focuses on UI/UX development. You cannot place an order in real-time.

## Technical Details

- **Frontend Framework:** Flikipedia is built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **Styling:** I've used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

- **Build Tool:** The project is powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a fast and minimalist build tool for modern web development.
